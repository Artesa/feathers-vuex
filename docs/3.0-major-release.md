# What's new in Feathers-Vuex 3.0

## Vue Composition API Support

Version 3.0 of Feathers-Vuex is the Vue Composition API release!  There were quite a few disappointed (and misinformed:) developers in 2019 when the Vue.js team announced what is now called the Vue Composition API.  From my perspective:

- It is the most powerful feature added to Vue since its first release.
- It improves the ability to create dynamic functionality in components.
- It greatly enhances organization of code in components.
- It encourages code re-use. Check out the [vue-use-web](https://logaretm.github.io/vue-use-web/) collection for some great examples.

And now it has become the best way to perform queries with Feathers-Vuex.  To find out how to take advantage of the new functionality in your apps, read the [Feather-Vuex Composition API docs](./composition-api.md).

## Custom Handling for Feathers Events <Badge text="3.1.0+" />

Version 3.1 of Feathers-Vuex enables ability to add custom handling for each of the FeathersJS realtime events.  You can read more about it in the [Service Plugin: Events](./service-plugin.md#service-events) docs.

## Breaking Changes

Feathers-Vuex follows semantic versioning.  There are two breaking changes in this release:

### Auth Plugin `user` Not Reactive <Badge text="3.2.0+" />

Due to changes in how reactivity is applied to service state (it's now using Vue.set under the hood), the `user` state of the `auth` module is no longer reactive.  To fix this issue, two getters have been added to the `auth` state.  They are available when a `userService` is provided to the `makeAuthPlugin` options.

- `user`: returns the reactive, logged-in user from the `userService` specified in the options.
- `isAuthenticated`: a easy to remember boolean attribute for if the user is logged in.


### Server-Side Pagination Support is Off by Default

The `makeFindMixin` (and the new `useFind` utility) now have server-side pagination support turned off, by default.  Real-time arrays of results are now the default setting.  This really improves the development experience, especially for new users.

To migrate your app to version 3.0, you need to update any `params` where you are using server-side pagination.  It will work as it has been in version 2.0 once you explicitly set `paginate: true` in the params, like this:

```js
import { makeFindMixin } from 'feathers-vuex'

export default {
  name: 'MyComponent',
  mixins: [ makeFindMixin({ service: 'users', watch: true })],
  computed: {
    usersParams() {
      return {
        query: {},
        paginate: true // explicitly enable pagination, now.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This behavior exactly matches the new `useFind` utility.

## One Deprecation

The `keepCopiesInStore` option is now deprecated.  This was a part of the "clone and commit" API which basically disabled the reason for creating the "clone and commit" API in the first place.

If you're not familiar with the Feathers-Vuex "clone and commit" API, you can learn more about the [built-in data modeling](./model-classes.md) API and the section about [Working with Forms](./feathers-vuex-form-wrapper.md#the-clone-and-commit-pattern).

The `keepCopiesInStore` feature is set to be removed in Feathers-Vuex 4.0.
